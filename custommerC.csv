    Watch our for fakes or bad quality originals
  
",25-Feb-19,1,Number of Items: 6Black/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Large,2,"          I saw a review that stated the versions without the size printed on the bottom are fake. I am thinking the same. I bought a 12 pack (which is really 2 packs of 6 pairs) of the same socks and they feel super soft and feel pretty good quality. I will need to wear them for much longer to see if they are durable. They have the size printed on the bottom. I bought another 6 pack from a different seller fulfilled by Amazon, and the socks did not have the size. They also felt way less soft. There are subtle differences in the print on the socks as well. I think they are either fake or just a new or old version that is less quality than the first ones I got so I returned them.The reason I think they are fake is because Under Armour online (where I shop directly from all the time) has the socks with the size printed on the bottom. I will purchase from them.  ",complaint

",18-Apr-18,1,Number of Items: 6Black/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: X-Large,1,"          Apparently Under Armour quality has gone down the crapper. Bought 12 pairs of these around a year ago.

    Don't waist your money... total subpar product.
  
",28-Jan-20,1,Number of Items: 6White/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Large,1,"          These socks are awful. I will never, ever buy these again. There is no chance these are real Under Armour products. After wearing and washing only one time, the socks are super stretched out and unwearable. Strings/threads inside the socks get caught on nails when your putting them on and when you're wearing them rendering them very uncomfortable.  So between being all stretched out falling off in your shoe, threads all wound up around your toes, and non breathable fabric, these socks are a total waste of money... don't bother.  ",complaint

    Poor Quality. Not a real Under Armour product.
  
",7-Jun-19,1,Number of Items: 6White/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Large,1,"          This is my second time wearing these socks and look how much they've worn out. Very poor quality for an Under Armour product. I suspect these to be fake. The material composition listed on Amazon is different than what is on the Under Armour website. I also bought the same pair of socks but in Black. However the size isn't embroidered on the bottom as pictured in the Amazon listing. I purchased the same sock from Under Armour directly and they came with the sizes on the bottom of the sock.Update: I contacted Under Armor. They said If the product description such as the materials the socks are made out of don't match the description on the Under Armour website then I should return the product because there's probably not authentic. They also said if the product receive doesn't match the product images then they're probably not authentic. They also said that all of their socks except for kids socks will have the size embroidered on the bottom, if the ones I received from Amazon didn't, then they're not authentic. Three different indescrepancies allude to these socks being counterfeits.Look at the second picture I posted. The black sock on the left was purchased from Amazon and worn only a few times. The black sock on the right was purchased from underarmour.com and it's been more than multiple times throughout at least over a year.  ",complaint

    These socks fall apart after the first wash
  
",14-Jun-20,1,Number of Items: 6Black/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Large,1,"          I expected a good quality sock, because of the price and name brand.  However, the socks came with tiny holes already in them - every one of them.  Then, I washed them according to manufacturers instructions, and they came out looking pilly, and the fabric was fraying - as if they had been washed about 50 times. I was extremely disappointed in the socks. I wasted every penny of the expensive socks.  Do not waste your money buying these socks!!!!  ",complaint

    I have been buying these for four years now
  
",10-Nov-21,1,Number of Items: 6Black/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: X-Large,5,"          So I started buying these socks over four years ago when I was first dating my ex. I have a bad knee and they were very soft, and cushiony. And even though I have a size 7 1/2 women’s and he wore a size 11 1/2 men’s, I was still successful in stealing all of these socks because I loved them so much. They definitely wear down overtime and I can always tell which ones are newer and which ones are older. But with the amount that I wear these, especially in my home that has hardwood flooring, this helps give some padding in between my feet and the floor, so my knee does not hurt as easily or quickly. They are super soft, super plush, and I have never been disappointed. I buy an extra large in these, and it makes them even softer and thicker because the extra large is made to sit and stretch to larger feet. I will NEVER buy any other pair of socks again. When my relationship with my ex ended terribly, I still messaged him specifically for the link to the socks because I need a new pairs, and there was no way I was going to buy any other brand or type of socks lololol. I will live in these now, and I will demand to be buried in these when I pass hahah  ",compliment

",11-Nov-18,1,Number of Items: 6Black/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Medium,1,"          I bought a 6-pack of the black and white version of the Under Armour Men's Resistor III Lo Cut Socks and both of them had all the socks with terrible stitching. I spent $11.04 for the black 6-pack socks and $14.73 for the white 6-pack socks for a total of $27.70 at checkout. I don't know how someone could charge that much for socks with terrible quality like displayed in those photos. Clearly Under Armour is not a brand that focuses on the quality of their products before shipping them to a customer. I'll just stick to the brands I know that don't give me socks with a mess like this on the inside. If they can replace these socks for something with quality I'd expect then I'll change this review, but until then I recommend staying away from this product.  ",complaint

    Most comfortable socks I own
  
",24-Aug-21,1,Number of Items: 6White/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Large,5,"          These are easily the most generally-comfortable socks I own.  They're a perfect every-day sock.  Soft and thick, but not too thick to be too hot in the summer.  Supportive, but not overly supportive.  And they've lasted for a while now without noticeably losing either of those things.  I go with a more supportive sock with an extra heel tab for hiking, and a thinner sock for doing things like lawn work, but find myself wearing these socks first for the normal every-day, and I'm actually a little bummed if I run out and have to switch to other socks before laundry day.  Never thought I'd see the day I had a favorite pair of socks.  I guess this is what it's like getting old?  ",compliment

My only feedback is that they leave a lot of fuzz, and the if you turn the sock inside out you'll see a lot of loose threads, or the ends of threads. It doesn't affect the comfort, but it just seems very unusual and I think it contributes to more lint.  ",neutral

    Absolutely horrid. Goes into the bin after one wear.
  
",3-Feb-20,1,Number of Items: 6Black/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Large,1,"          These have to be some of the worst socks I've ever bought. First, I have had this exact sock (brand and style) for a few years (picked them up at Costco.) The ones being sold here are so different that unless someone can prove me wrong, I am highly suspicious that these are counterfeit. Either that or UA has gone steeply downhill. You can clearly see that the sewing on these socks is a quick technique and is poorly done. The seams aren't finished. The first pair I took out of the package to put on, one sock immediately said if you pull too hard your toes just might go through the front. I bought two packs of these (white & black) and both are just so so bad. Also, the quality of the fabric is MUCH much more different than my other UA socks which are sturdier and have a better shape. Poorly sewn, very cheap fabric. I'll either order directly from their site or find another brand. My UA socks from Costco have lasted YEARS and I can already tell these will be single-use socks.

Immediately comparing these to store bought they are noticeably thinner material and no where near as soft to the touch. After a single wear each pair had noticeable wear and tear and had little material “burrs” fraying all over the soles. I’ve had store pairs that look better after a year or more wearing. Thought I’d take a quick easy path to make sure i had plenty for a 4 week vacation. Didn’t figure these are almost “disposable” quality. Heed everyone’s comments regarding the size printed on the bottom. If it doesn’t have it, I’m in agreement that they are knock-offs.  ",complaint

Second set was horrible, some of the socks were too small, despite having the same ""size"" (LG) listed on the foot. And all of them had strings sticking out on every edge. I bought the second pair almost a year ago, and some of them are falling apart. Frankly, I would not buy these socks again under these conditions, and it dampens my opinion of the brand as a whole.

Concerned i still bought these socks hoping they wouldnt be too big for my size 10 feet. They fit perfectly snug and i guess being ankle socks they wrap a little more higher up my ankles however the comfort of these socks are beyond any other sock ive ever owned. They material is super comfortable on your feet and help you from not having sweaty or stinky feet at the end of the day. Overall these are my favorite socks by far.  ",

",4-Jan-17,1,Number of Items: 6Black/Graphite (6-pairs)Size: Large,5,"          I've been wearing Under Armour Lo Cut socks for years and keep coming back for more. These socks have been my go to for everyday use as well as fitness. They last a long time and maintain their elasticity through a plethora of laundry cycles. They look good in the black and fit at a comfortable position as advertised, low on the ankle. I am an avid runner and crossfitter and these are the socks that I wear when I workout. They provide adequate cushioning for my feet as well as staying firm in position. I've worn other socks in the past that slip or fall apart and I will never go back. The only negative about these socks is that they soak up a lot of moisture during extremely sweaty workouts. Living in the south of the US these socks can often become water logged when I'm exercising in the summer. I don't blame the socks for this, but I wanted to make the observation.  ",
